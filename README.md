# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind Kanban Board

This project used this tutorial as a starting point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG-3R6Pu_Ik

I built this project to get familiar with Tailwind and Dnd Kit. From there, I made styling changes, and some functionality changes.

TODO:

- Limit number of Work In Progress tasks
- Store tasks in local storage and a cloud service
- Add auth maybe
- Finish adjusting the styling (light/dark modes)
